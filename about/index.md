My name is Rachith Aiyappa

I'm currently in my final year of a five year dual degree program at Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, K.K Birla Goa Campus in India. The two degrees I am pursing are : **B.E (Hons.) in Engineering** and an **M.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics**

I'm currently an intern at the Institute of Theoretical Biology at Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. Here, I am working on information cascades in adaptive collective animal networks.

I've previously been an intern at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune, India), Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India) and Collective Animal Behaviour lab (Univeristy of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France)

I like physics but I love tennis. Been playing the sport since I was as tall as the racquet! Simpler times!

Actually, I like lots of other things. More on that to follow...
