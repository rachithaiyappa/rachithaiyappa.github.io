1. [I709](https://rachithaiyappa.github.io/I709/) - This contains a one slide summary  (and trasncript of my presentations) off seminal work in different topics of complex systems and networks. Reading these papers was part of the the weekly assignment in the Advanced Seminar II in Complex Systems (I709) course at IU hosted by Dr. Filippo Radicchi.
