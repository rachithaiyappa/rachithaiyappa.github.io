It is always a pleasure to be in the company of someone who thoroughly enjoys what they do. 
Although rare, it isn’t too hard to recognize it when you cross paths with them.
However, the risk of this being a projection/cover harbored by the ‘someone’ always exists.

*Unfortunate and thought-provoking stories of comedians and their struggles with mental health come to mind. 
Another example points to Andre Agassi, who hated playing the sport of tennis and yet today, 
is regarded as one of the greatest players to have graced the game. Certainly, the greatest returner of serve? 
(cough-Novak-cough)*

However, the risk of this being a projection/cover harbored by the ‘someone’ always exists.
As true as that is, I hope the individual I speak about here, 
who I think is genuinely passionate about his career (and life, in general), truly is! 

I spent the past four months at Berlin working towards my [Master’s Thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zF-q_Jy7Zx0OV8zRDERn4ye1g-OdWggo/view?usp=sharing). 
My experience is Germany was…well….different! 
Not the regular kind of different I usually write (or plan to write :P) about 
but the kind I have been seeking for quite sometime now!

A part of what made this `different’ so memorable is Dr. Pawel Romanczuk, my supervisor. 
Like any other young scientist, Pawel is actively involved in many, many things. 
He is the PI of the [Collective Information Processing lab](http://lab.romanczuk.de/) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin 
and part of the super cool [Science of Intelligence cluster](https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/). 

Spoiler alert, in Germany, I did not meet a lot of people who possessed/appreciated a good sense of humor. 
I’m glad Pawel wasn’t one of them :P

During my first call with Pawel and Winnie<sup id="myfootnotelinkback">[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>, 
I immediately took a liking to his proactive approach to research and enjoyed our honest and open conversation, 
not restricted to research. 
Lately, I’ve found myself having to make choices. 
I’ve never enjoyed making choices. 
I don’t think I ever will. 
But apparently, life says you can’t have it all.

*(Update June 2020) I still don't like making choices. I want it all 😛*

To a question I raised (outside of research) during my initial interactions with Pawel, 
not making an effort to hide the fact that he’s been through it all, he says,

***<div align="center">“Follow your gut!”</div>***

In doing so, I’m glad Berlin happened 🙂.<br />
To say the least, the past months served a selfish purpose of reminding me of a cliche - Love what you do.

I never did completely get used to him sitting down beside me (as he did with all of his brilliant students) 
on a weekly basis to discuss my (our) progress.
You could obviously point to it being ‘his job’ but trust my word, 
he certainly did not carry that aura of doing things just because it is his job. 
Pawel effortlessly processes information. 
He has a knack to offer constructive criticism and seems to have identified a perfect blend of 
hand-on and hand-off approach to supervision!
Watching him digest a week’s worth of work in the first few minutes of the meeting and 
read most of our thoughts before we explicitly voice them out, is an art I wish to understand someday! 
Ideas seemed to flow through him so smoothly that it was as if he was born with them. 

A friend termed it as a state of zen!

Troubled by the near-godliness of this individual, 
my last ‘in-person’ conversation (Update 2020: ~6 months before everyone’s last in-person conversation..oops pandemic!) 
with Pawel had me directly asking him how/why is he so good at what he does and if he was born with it! 
His response, typical to the minimalism you’ll see in this musing, was not anything out of the blue. 
One could even trivialize it to the daily motivational messages which overpopulate social media. 
There’s even a book about it, ‘Outliers’ by Malcolm Gladwell.  

**<div align="center">Practice - hard-work - what being around long enough teaches you - the Ph.D. process…yada yada.</div>**

At the same time, he did not dismiss the possibility of luck/chance happenings and did narrate a story (storytelling is one among his many skills which he’s obviously great at. Duh!). He is a statistical physicist after all :PIt was at that moment, my doubts about wanting to do a Ph.D. reduced and my pre-conceived notions were confirmed!


(Update 2020: I’m now all set to start my Ph.D. studies in Informatics (complex networks and systems) at Indian University, Bloomington. Without Pawel and Winnie’s help, this would’ve remained a dream)
After almost all our meetings, I was left questioning, “Did I just witness him write code in front of me!?”, “Wait! Why didn’t I think of that!?”, “I’m clearly stupid but how did he normalize my mistakes as an essential part of research!?”…I’d never witnessed a supervisor write code or find bugs with their students until then! 

During one of our many casual conversations, he spoke about his days leading up to being a PI. 
I hope you get to hear the story, which is his to recite, I hope you get to hear it from him someday.


A snippet,<br />
Not so long ago, after a certain stage of one’s education in Germany, 
before they proceed with their careers, a short stint in the military or a civil service was mandatory. 
Pawel chose the latter and spoke fondly (like he did, about many things) about his experiences.
***<div align="center"> “Everything you do, changes you” </div>***
<br />
is what Pawel said speaking about his journey to where he is right now.

The profound minimalism his casual quotes carry share similarities with his communication of 
(scientific) ideas - complex yet comprehendible, an under-appreciated superpower.

During my short time at his lab, <br />
I did not see him patronize/be condescending. 
I did not see him NOT give credit where it is due. 
I did not see him pissed (unless you call for it by preaching homeopathy to him :P).<br/>
I did see him extremely busy. 
I did see him stay late in the office/arrive early. 
I did see him being burdened with duties outside of research. 
I did see him make time for his students despite all this.

But through all of this, I did not see/hear him complain 
(no, not even about the bureaucracy a visitor to Germany is warned about :P)

These might be little things that are often overlooked. 
As far back as I can remember, I was told, but rarely shown, that little things matter! 
It matters not only for one to set and reach their goals but more importantly in defining one as an individual. 
I’m glad had Pawel gave me a chance to witness and confirmed this for myself.

To most, Pawel might seem to conduct life no different than you and I. 
Like you and I, Pawel might have his imperfections (although I haven’t seen them). 
But take a closer look and you get the impression that he does enjoy the process, truly. 
I’m unsure if that’s a universal trait amongst us. 

My writing, as usual, fails to capture all the five senses. 
I conceded with this;
leading upto my thesis, 
I had a fair idea of my passion and what gives knew thing which makes me happy but 
Pawel showed me what it takes and what it is to enjoy the process. He humanized it for me 🙂

Winnie’s (Update 2020: might be nearing the end of her Ph.D. now) 
brilliance requires a write-up of its own. 
Her untainted patience bore the brunt of my never-ending questions 
(code, bugs, science, coffee with/without milk, benefits of being legally married in Germany, etc ). 
Few times, a short meeting with Winnie before we met Pawel saved me from  take away a good laugh 
If Pawel didn’t go back home and laugh at my stupidity
Fun fact: I once accused the computer, as I often do, of having a mind of its own. 
I kid you not, for the longest time, the program used to run fine when I was sitting in front of the computer. 
But go out for lunch/snack only to return to see a dead program. You could almost see the monitor’s vile smirk. 
Of course, it was a bug in the program. 
And of course, Winnie was there with a celebratory smirk 
when I nudged her (this time, without a question) for the nth time that week!
