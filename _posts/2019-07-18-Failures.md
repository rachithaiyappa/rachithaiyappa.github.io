Stanlislas Wawrinka, is a name in the sport of tennis often overshadowed by a man who is considered to be synonymous with the sport itself! Roger Federer, a fellow Swiss, needs not introduction. Infact, any introduction is but an understatement and the Sisyphean task of writing about Federer is like thinking of a new colour!
Yet, come 2014, Wawrinka found himself at the receiving end of a well deserved breakthrough coupled with a newly found motivation which led to him obliterating the big names of the sport. He went on to win the Australian Open in 2014, the French Open in 2015 and the US Open in 2016. With this, he earned himself the nickname of Stanimal, which is pretty self explanatory given the power on his groundstrokes and style of play! 

Through all his victories and defeats, truimphs and disasters, this picture stuck with me. It is a quote by Samuel Beckett. I studied Beckett's nihilistic play "Waiting for Godot" during my time in BITS but never for once thought, nihilism can also give rise to inspiration! 

"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better."

I am going to sound like a celebrity when I say that I have been at the receving end of an umpteen number of questions, fundamentally boiling down to a notion of utopia which most individuals aim to achieve. Ofcourse, the very definition of utopia loses meaning without the notion of dystopia. This notion of 'relative definitions' isn't new, yet, its meaning isn't ingrained in everyday life!

A year ago, I received a scholarship. In view of this article, let me just stick to saying that the scholarship did me a lot of good. Following this, I was interviewed by a journalist, who asked me a question, the reponse to which, ought to reflect my state of mind back then : 

> Q : How do you feel being amongst the 13 in India to get this internship? What does it mean to you?

> A : Frankly, hearing that I had been awarded this scholarship didnâ€™t bring in the greatest of joys as such. What means more to me is knowing the things I did right and the amount I learnt in the process of finding this internship and then applying for the scholarship.
