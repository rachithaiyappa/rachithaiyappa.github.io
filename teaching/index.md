Between August-Decemeber 2019, I am at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India as a Teaching Fellow (TF) in the Physics Department. 
Principles of Science is a Foundational Course (FC) which is taken up by a diverse set of undegraduate students, mostly in their first or second year.  
The Physics Department, for the first time since its inception three years ago (the university is quite new...about 5 years old) is offering this course. Prof. Gautam Menon, a statistical physicsit by training (yay!) conducts the lecture sessions and Gaurang (a fellow TF) and I conduct a 6 discussion sessions (DS, 3 each) on a weekly basis where we dive deeper into the essence of this course. 

Not all of the students enrolled in this course will major in conventional domains as Physics, Chemistry Biology, Mathematics or Computer Science. A major fraction of these students will go on to major in a variety of dsisciples such as English Literature, Politcal Science, Psychology, Economics, Finace, History, Anthropology etc. 

The challenge then becomes to convey what can science (as we know it) do to better an individual, not just academically, but as a person! In doing so we make it a point not to impose our opinion . Instead, they are offered a ton of information and resources to come up with their own opinion!
Rather than explcity defining the strcuture or the essence of this course, I suggest you read along and frame your own idea of what principles of science mean to you!
It is a herculean task for me to write about what happens in roughly 6 hours of class each week and I do not intend to do that. Instead, here are certain discussions which I vividly rememeber from each week and in subtle ways pride myself for initiating such thought among my new friends!

PS : This is in no way a Physics course. Rather, it deals with fundamentals. An intuition for numbers, for estimates; the efficacy of a graph, a function; the universality of hypothesis-data-iterations; the role of bias, of being in a bubble, of having your thoughts influenced by the newspapers you read, the social meida you; use are prominent in every day life. Taking a plethora of examples from current affairs a linking this to fundamentals of science, this course aims to make one not just learned collective, but aware as an individual. 

## Week 1 : The scientific method, without giving it a name!

Context : Prof. Menon showed this in class after posing an interesting question of how one could differntiate two people on either side of the Wagah border (the border between India and Pakistan at near Amritsar) if the border did not exist. Long story short, it hinted how genetically similar/different individuals of the human race can be.

A student in class voiced his discomfort with the spelling of `sceptic` and opined that it should be `skeptic` instead. Ofcourse murmurs from the rest of the class leaned to the conventional argument of British English versus American English. 

I saw an opportunity in this to hint at the scientific methodology (hypothesis-data-iteration) :

DS : I acknowledged their reponse pertaining to the differences in British versus American English. But to convey my thought, we spoke about two examples : 

Case 1: skeptic vs sceptic : I asked them to go back in time to when a printing press did not exist and stamps containing individual letters might have been used to make documents. Trying not to get myself distracted into power laws in Physics, here is how it went :

~~~~
Rachith: Suppose I pick out two letters from a book written in English, say `t` and `z`. 
Which one do you think will be used more frequently in the book?

The class collectively answers `t`

Rachith: Given that you've told me that `t` is more frequently used, 
which stamp do y'all think is more prone to wear and tear? Is it `t` or `z`

The class collectively answers `t`

Rachith: Similarly, if I were to tell you the letter `c` is/was more frequently used than the letter `k`
and hence former's stamp wears out faster than the latter's, 
would it not make sense for me to replace `c` with `k` if 
it does not lead to a change in the pronunciation of the word?

Class:  ðŸ˜®
~~~~

Case 2: colour vs color

~~~~
Rachith: Let us stick to the time when the printing press did not exist and we relied on stamps. 
If I was to get a document 'printed', most likely  I would be charged a fee based on the number of letters, 
in other words, the number of stamps. Agree?

Class: Seems reasonable

Rachith : So would it not make sense for me to shorten my words (by reducing the number of letters in them), 
without changing its pronounciation whenever possible?

Class: ðŸ˜®
~~~~

Take away : Acknowledge that countless hypotheses can seem to explain a certain phenomena. Realise what it means to hypothesize. Question how would one go about proving or disproving a hypothesis. Can a hypothesis always be proved/disproved?

## Week 2 : What do you believe in?

This week was mostly spent in giving examples and counter examples showing the subjectivity and objectivity of human thought.

I posed a very general question to the class. If I recollect correctly, thumping my clenched fist in the air to emphasise the gravity of the question hitting them, I asked "What do you guys belive in or look for when it comes to making decisions"

Not surprisingly I heard a variety of responses some of which stuck with me....

Response 1 : Logic

Inevitably I brought in the man himself, Richard Feynman.
<img src="/images/feynman_experiment.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="200" >
I tried giving the class example of aether, a medium once thought to occupy free space which, to boil it down, was once considered the answer to the question "The speed of light is ... with respect to what/who?". As logical as this hypothesis of aether sounded, it was proved to be wrong by the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiment. 
At this point, if I could read the minds of the diverse set students in the class, I'm sure they would have been thinking, "ugh! I chose not to do science and here is this dude boring me with things I will never care about".
I resorted to a very crude logical fallacy :

~~~~
Rachith: If someone was to teach his/her the concept of addition to his/her friend who believes in logic in the following way : 

Someone : 2 + 2 = 4
          2 * 2 = 4
          3 + 3 = 6
          3 * 3 = ?
What would the friend respond to this?

Class: ðŸ˜®

Rachith : What sounds logical to us, may not sound logical to our neighbours or to the universe. 
In other words, the universe does not function according to our logic. 
That is what I find the most beautiful...how oblivious 'she' can to our existence 
~~~~

Response 2 : Majority Opinion

I was extremely tempted to disucss my master thesis about information cascades in adaptive network and how things can get really messed up leading to fake news, rumors etc.
