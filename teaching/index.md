Between August-Decemeber 2019, I am at Ashoka University in Sonipat, India as a Teaching Fellow (TF) in the Physics Department. 
Principles of Science is a Foundational Course (FC) which is taken up by a diverse set of undegraduate students, mostly in their first or second year.  
The Physics Department, for the first time since its inception three years ago (the university is quite new...about 5 years old) is offering this course. Prof. Gautam Menon, a statistical physicsit by training (yay!) conducts the lecture sessions and Gaurang (a fellow TF) and I conduct a 6 discussion sessions (DS, 3 each) on a weekly basis where we dive deeper into the essence of this course. 

Not all of the students enrolled in this course will major in conventional domains as Phyics, Chemistry Biology, Mathematics or Computer Science. A major fraction of these students will go on to major in a variety of dsisciples such as English Literature, Politcal Science, Psychology, Economics, Finace, History, Anthropology etc. 

The challenge then becomes to convey what can science (as we know it) do to better an individual, not just academically, but as a person! In doing so we make it a point not to impose our opinion . Instead, they are offered a ton of information and resources to come up with their own opinion!
Rather than explcity defining the strcuture or the essence of this course, some interesting discussion 

PS : This is in no way a Physics course. Rather, it deals with fundamentals. An intuition for numbers, for estimates; the efficacy of a graph, a function; the universality of hypothesis-data-iterations; the role of bias, of being in a bubble, of having your thoughts influenced by the newspapers you read, the social meida you; use are prominent in every day life. Taking a plethora of examples from current affairs a linking this to fundamentals of science, this course aims to make one not just learned collective, but aware as an individual. 

## Week 1
Context : Prof. Menon showed this in class after posing an interesting question of how one could differntiate two people on either side of the Wagah border (the border between India and Pakistan at near Amritsar) if the border did not exist. Long story short, it hinted how genetically similar/different individuals of the human race can be.

A student in class voiced his discomfort with the spelling of `sceptic` and opined that it should be `skeptic` instead. Ofcourse murmurs from the rest of the class leaned to the conventional argument of British English versus American English. 

I saw an opportunity in this to hint at the scientific methodology (hypothesis-data-iteration) :

DS : We spoke about two examples : 
Case 1 : skeptic vs sceptic 

Case 2 : colour vs color
