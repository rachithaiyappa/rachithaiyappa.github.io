        <p>My name is Rachith Aiyappa.</p>
        <p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student majoring in <a href = "https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/phd-informatics/complex-networks-and-systems.html">Informatics (Complex Networks and Systems track) </a> with a minor in Computer Science at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering at Indiana University Bloomington. Not so long ago, this seemed like a distant dream.

        <p>My current research broadly encompasses belief networks, social information diffusion, and natural language processing. Some of my ongoing projects include</p>,
          <ul>
            <li> Extracting belief networks from social media data </li>
            <li> Large Language Models and Stance Detection | <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02368">arxiv </a> </li>
            <li> Large Language Models and Social Surveys </li>
            <li> Belief Embeddings </li></ul>
        <p> In the recent past, I've worked on </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Modelling human belief networks and social contagion with the super cool Drs. <a href ="https://luddy.indiana.edu/contact/profile/?Alessandro_Flammini"> Alessandro Flammini </a> and <a href = "https://yongyeol.com/"> </a> | <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02368)">arxiv </a>, forthcoming in Science Advances.</li> 
            <li> Identifying and characterizing superspreaders of information on Twitter with the <a href = "https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/">Networks and Agents Network (NaN)</a> and <a href = "https://osome.iu.edu/">OsoMe</a> teams led by <a href = "https://cnets.indiana.edu/fil/">Dr. Filippo Menczer</a> | <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02368>arxiv</a>  </li>
            <li> Graph Compression with <a href= "https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~filiradi/"> Dr. Filippo Radicchi </a> </li>
            <li> Some bit of machine learning to identify influential nodes in networks.</li></ul>
  
        <p>Between August-December 2020, I was a Teaching Fellow in the Physics Department at <a href = "https://www.ashoka.edu.in/"> Ashoka University, India </a> 
          where I helped run a foundational course called Principles of Science which I deeply believe it. Teaching is indeed therapeutic!</p>
        <p>In July 2019, I graduated with a dual degree, a <strong>B.E (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering</strong> and an <strong>M.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics</strong> 
          from <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/"> Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, India </a>.</p>
        <p>During the 5 years it took me to earn this dual degree, I have enjoyed rains on Marine Drive while interning at the 
          <a href = "https://www.iucaa.in/"> Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune, India)</a>, cliff dived into the Mediterranean whilst a 
          Charpak Summer Research Scholar at <a href = "https://crca.cbi-toulouse.fr/en/guytheraulaz/"> Collective Animal Behaviour lab (University of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France)</a>, 
          cherished mum's company during my Bachelor Thesis at the <a href = "https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/"> Theoretical Ecology and Evolution lab at Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India)</a>
          and experienced a massive culture shock during my Master Thesis at <a href = "http://lab.romanczuk.de/?"> Institute of Theoretical Biology at Humboldt University (Berlin, Germany)</a>.</p>
        <p>Just to reiterate, yes I have a degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering :P</p>
        <p>I like physics but I love tennis. Been playing the sport since I was as tall as the racquet! Simpler times!</p>
        <p>Actually, I like and do lots of other things. More on that to follow...</p>
        <p>Long story short, happy times these :)</p>
