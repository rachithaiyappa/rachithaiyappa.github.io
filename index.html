        <p>My name is Rachith Aiyappa.</p>
        <p>I am a third year student in the <a href = "https://informatics.indiana.edu/programs/phd-informatics/complex-networks-and-systems.html">Informatics (Complex Networks and Systems) Ph.D. program </a> at the Luddy School of Informatics, 
          Computing and Engineering at Indiana University in Bloomington with a minor in Computer Science. Not so long ago, this seemed like a distant dream.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am studying for my qualification exams. Exciting times!</p>
        <p>My ongoing projects include</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Identifying superspreaders of information on Twitter with the <a href= "https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/"> Networks and Agents Network (NaN) </a>  team led by 'OsoMe (read - awesome)' Dr. Fil Menczer at IU.</li>  
            <li> Modelling (and hopefully emprically validating via Large Language Models) human belief networks and social contagion with the super cool <a href= "https://yongyeol.com/"> Dr. YY Ahn </a>. </li>
            <li> Graph Compression with <a href= "https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~filiradi/"> Dr. Filippo Radicchi </a> </li>
            <li> Some bit of machine learning to identify inluential nodes in networks.</li></ul>
        <p><i>Did you notice how I've just used a bunch of buzzwords? :P</i></p>
        <p> A bit about my recent academic past</p>
        <p>Between August-December 2020, I was a Teaching Fellow in the Physics Department at <a href = "https://www.ashoka.edu.in/"> Ashoka University, India </a> 
          where I helped run a foundational course called Principles of Science which I deeply believe it. Teaching is indeed therapeutic!</p>
        <p>In July 2019, I gradauted with dual degree, a <strong>B.E (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering</strong> and an <strong>M.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics</strong> 
          from <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/"> Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, India </a>.</p>
        <p>During the 5 years it took me to earn this dual degree, I have enjoyed rains on Marine Drive while interning at the 
          <a href = "https://www.iucaa.in/"> Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune, India)</a>, cliff dived into Mediterranean whilst a 
          Charpak Summer Research Scholar at <a href = "https://crca.cbi-toulouse.fr/en/guytheraulaz/"> Collective Animal Behaviour lab (Univeristy of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France)</a>, 
          cherished mum's company during my Bachelor Thesis at the <a href = "https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/"> Theoretical Ecology and Evolution lab at Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India)</a>
          and experienced a massive culture shock during my Master Thesis at <a href = "http://lab.romanczuk.de/?"> Institute of Theoretical Biology at Humboldt University (Berlin, Germany)</a>.</p>
        <p>Just to reiterate, yes I have a degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering :P</p>
        <p>I like physics but I love tennis. Been playing the sport since I was as tall as the racquet! Simpler times!</p>
        <p>Actually, I like and do lots of other things. More on that to follow...</p>
        <p>Long story short, happy times these :)</p>
