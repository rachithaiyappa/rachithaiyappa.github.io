        <p>My name is Rachith Aiyappa</p>
        <p>I am a second year student in the Informatics (Complex Networks and Systems) Ph.D. program at the Luddy School of Informatics, 
          Computing and Engineering at Indiana University in Bloomington. Not so long ago, this seemed like a distant dream.</p>
        <p>Currently, apart from drowning in "exiciting" coursework, I work on a bunch of projects</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Identifying superspreaders of information on Twitter with the <a href= "https://cnets.indiana.edu/groups/nan/"> Networks and Agents Network (NaN) </a>  team led by 'OsoMe (read - awesome)' Dr. Fil Menczer at IU.</li>  
            <li> Modelling (and hopefully emprically validating) human belief networks and social contagion with the super cool <a href= "https://yongyeol.com/"> Dr. YY Ahn </a>. </li>
            <li> Graph Compression (read embeddings) with <a href= "https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~filiradi/"> Dr. Filippo Radicchi </a> and applying this to science of science. </li>
            <li> Some bit of machine learning to identify inluential nodes in networks.</li><\ul>
        <p><i>Did you note down how I've just used a bunch of buzzwords? :P</i></p>
        <p>Between August-December 2020, I was a Teaching Fellow in the Physics Department at Ashoka University, India 
          where I helped run a foundational course called Principles of Science which I deeply believe it. Teaching is indeed therapeutic!</p>
        <p>In July 2019, I gradauted with dual degree, a <strong>B.E (Hons.) in Mechanical Engineering</strong> and an <strong>M.Sc.(Hons.) in Physics</strong> 
          from Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, India.</p>
        <p>During the 5 years it took me to earn this dual degree, I have enjoyed rains on Marine Drive while interning at the 
          Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (Pune, India), jumped off a cliff into the Mediterranean whilst a 
          Charpak Summer Research Scholar at Collective Animal Behaviour lab (Univeristy of Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France), 
          cherished mum's company during my Bachelor Thesis at the Theoretical Ecology and Evolution lab at Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India) 
          and experienced a massive cultural shock during my Master Thesis at Institute of Theoretical Biology at Humboldt University (Berlin, Germany).</p>
        <p>Just to reiterate, yes I have a degree in Physics and Mechanical Engineering :P</p>
        <p>I like physics but I love tennis. Been playing the sport since I was as tall as the racquet! Simpler times!</p>
        <p>Actually, I like and do lots of other things. More on that to follow...</p>
        <p>Long story short, happy times these :)</p>
